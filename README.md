# A Football Stat Tracker
## Overview
The **A Football Stat Tracker** is my passion project. At the end of my first production build, I intend it to be a versatile tool tailored for football enthusiasts, amateur teams and players to effortlessly manage and monitor their statistics. 
Whether you're an indiviudal player aiming to keep a detailed record of your performance or a small league organizer seeking in-depth statistical insights, this app should be able to provide a comprehensive solution. For now, I've submitted a very barebones infrastructure.

## Key Features
- Player Statistics:  Easily log and track player statistics, including goals and assists.
  - I am including a "Player Attribute" stat category (Like FIFA games) for future use.
- Teams: Creation of teams.
  - I will implement a more robust team creation, especially creating temporary team using a list of available players
- Clean UI is in the works.
- Database Integration: All data is designed to be stored in a mySQL database.

## Application is Work-In-Progress. 
I have the backbones code here. I will continuously develop this project.
